			<p>Horses are ungulates — mammals with hooves. They also have long tails, short
				hair, muscular torsos, long thick necks and elongated heads. Due to domestication,
				they are found all over the world. Horses have lived on Earth for more than 50
				million years, according the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
